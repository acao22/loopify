# Loopify - Music Song & Playlist Crowdsourcing Platform

**Team Members:** James Baker, Grace Thanglerdsumpan, Angie Cao, Jasper Zhu, Namita Sajai, Avi Upadhyaula

**Description:**  
Loopify is a music discovery platform that uses crowdsourcing to categorize songs into specific vibes. Users create theme-based playlist names, such as “road trip anthems” or “late-night thoughts,” and can vote on whether assigned songs fit the vibe. This platform allows users to collaboratively define playlist moods, making music discovery more community-driven and accurate.

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Loopify addresses the challenge of finding music that fits specific moods or themes, which can be limited in traditional, algorithm-driven music platforms. By integrating user-driven playlists with mood-based song matching, Loopify creates a personalized, community-centered music discovery experience.

### Project Type

Crowdsourcing platform

### Target Audience

Music lovers of all ages who enjoy exploring and sharing music through mood-specific playlists. This includes anyone from teens to adults who want a more curated way to find songs that match their mood.

### Incentives

Active users gain vibe-matched song recommendations and can earn badges like "Playlist Pro" or "Vibe Guru," rewarding participation and building a music-based community.

Quality control tools let users report "off-vibe" tags, ensuring that playlists remain on-theme and accurate.

**Milestones:**

- Build tools for flagging irrelevant content.
- Require a minimum upvote threshold for playlists to be published.
- Use moderation to remove misfit songs and playlists based on community feedback.

### 6. **Backend Infrastructure and Data Management**

**Point Value:** 3  
**Description:**  
A robust backend infrastructure supports playlist data management, user voting, and AI model data, ensuring scalability for high user activity.

**Milestones:**

- Set up a scalable database to store playlists, tags, and votes.
- Develop APIs to handle data fetching and posting.
- Optimize database performance for real-time user interactions.

### 7. **Analytics and Metrics Tracking**
